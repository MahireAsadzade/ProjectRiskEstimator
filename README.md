It is the the development of a software module that can predict the risks of a new software project before its development begins through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.
The significance is to help early planning of project resources, reallocation of budget and rearrengament of timetable. In traditional risk management identifying and preparing mitigation strategies is done when the development of the project is already underway, while in ai-based risk management instead it is performed before development begins. This way, the team gains more time prepare mitigation plans to deal with risks.
